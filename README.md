# PHASE2: HOUSING-PROJECT.
# PROJECT OVERVIEW.
This project entails the use of  multiple linear regression models using  data from ("kc_house_data.csv") to provide advice based on accurate and understandable valuations of the Real Estate sector in Kings County to Vision Real Estate Agency. 
# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
During this project, I assumed the role of a data scientist whereby I used our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") to generate 
various business problems that will be the founding blocks of our linear regression models.
# STAKEHOLDER
I assumed the role of a data scientist at Vision Real Estate Agency where I'm tasked at coming up with models that can predict house prices based on ceratin features in our dataset.
# Business problems:
### Model 1 :
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and  can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 2 :
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and the footage of the nearest 15 neighbours can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 3 : 
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home, the footage of the nearest 15 neighbours,  footage of the lot,  footage of the nearest 15 neighbours, number of floors, number of bathrooms,footage of basement and footage of above  can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 4 : 
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and condition of the home can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
Our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") contains Kings County housing data. The data set consists of 21 columns and 21612 rows.
The columns are: ![1_tfBY7bRc6ttOaBmUX4RVyg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110511316/192426070-98622317-8209-4533-b909-d2978a2ec870.png)
# DATA CLEANING.
This was done to ensure the Validity, Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency and Uniformity of the Data.

TASK1 :The first task was to check if the column names were uniform and readable.

TASK2 :The second task was to check for duplcated rows.

TASK3 :The next task was to check if there were missing values.

TASK4 :The next task was to decide how to deal with the missing values. (Either drop if they are unnecesary or replace the missing values with the best fit.)

TASK5 :The last task was to check if the columns had the correct data type.
