# PHASE2: HOUSING-PROJECT.
# PROJECT OVERVIEW.
This project entails the use of  multiple linear regression models using  data from ("kc_house_data.csv") to provide advice based on accurate and understandable valuations of the Real Estate sector in Kings County to Vision Real Estate Agency. 
# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
During this project, I assumed the role of a data scientist whereby I used our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") to generate 
various business problems that will be the founding blocks of our linear regression models.
# STAKEHOLDER
I assumed the role of a data scientist at Vision Real Estate Agency where I'm tasked at coming up with models that can predict house prices based on ceratin features in our dataset.
# Business problems:
### Model 1 :
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and  can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 2 :
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and the footage of the nearest 15 neighbours can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 3 : 
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home, the footage of the nearest 15 neighbours,  footage of the lot,  footage of the nearest 15 neighbours, number of floors, number of bathrooms,footage of basement and footage of above  can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
### Model 4 : 
Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the footage of a home and condition of the home can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
Our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") contains Kings County housing data. The data set consists of 21 columns and 21612 rows.
The columns are: ![1_tfBY7bRc6ttOaBmUX4RVyg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110511316/192426070-98622317-8209-4533-b909-d2978a2ec870.png)
# DATA CLEANING.
This was done to ensure the Validity, Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency and Uniformity of the Data.

TASK1 :The first task was to check if the column names were uniform and readable.

TASK2 :The second task was to check for duplcated rows.

TASK3 :The next task was to check if there were missing values.

TASK4 :The next task was to decide how to deal with the missing values. (Either drop if they are unnecesary or replace the missing values with the best fit.)

TASK5 :The last task was to check if the columns had the correct data type.
# MODELLING.
# MODEL 1

Simple Linear Regression Results
​Looking at the summary above, we can see that the regression line we found was​
log_price = (12.2185) + 0.0004sqft_living $$
​
* The model is statistically significant overall, with an F-statistic p-value well below our alpha of 0.05.
* The model explains about 48.5% of the variance in price.
* The model coefficients (`const` and `sqft_living`) are both statistically significant, with p-values well     below 0.05 . The y-intercept is at (12.2185).
* If a house added at least 1sqft living room space, we would expect it to have about (0.0004 * 100)% increase increase in price.

Model with Two Features ResultsThis time, the model we built was:log_price = ( 12.0815 ) + 0.0002sqft_living15  + 0.0003 sqft_living * The model is statistically significant overall, with an F-statistic p-value well below 0.05* The model explains about 50.5% of the variance in price which is an increase from our linear regression.* The model coefficients(`const`, `sqft_living15`, and `sqft_living`)are all statistically significant, with t-statistic p-values   well below 0.05* For each increase of 1  in sqft_living15, we see an associated increase in price of about 0.02%* For each increase of 1 in the sqft_living, we see an associated increase in price of about 0.03%
# MODEL 3
Model with Multiple Features Results
This time, the model we built was:
log_price  = ( 12.0553  ) + (-1.09e-06) sqft_lot15  +  0.0002 sqft_living + (3.129e-07 )sqft_lot +  0.1089floors + 0.0002sqft_living15 0.0165bathrooms + (-0.0454)bedrooms + (4.059e-05)sqft_above + 0.0002sqft_basement 
* The model is statistically significant overall, with an F-statistic p-value well below 0.05
* The model explains about 51.2% of the variance in price which is an increase from our linear regression.
* The model coefficients(`const`, `sqft_living15`, `sqft_living`,`sqft_lot15`,,`floors`,`bathrooms` ,`sqft_basement`,`above` and `bedrooms` )are all statistically significant, with t-statistic p-values  below 0.05
* A change in any of the  above features causes  a (coeeficient of the feature * 100)% change to price of a house.
# MODEL 4
Multiple linear Regression Results with categorical variables.
* ​Most features in  the  model are  statistically significant overall, with an F-statistic p-value well below our alpha of 0.05.
* The model explains about 49.3% of the variance in price.
* The model coefficients (`const`,`sqft_living`,`condition_3`,`condition_4` and `condition_5`) are both statistically significant, with p-values well below 0.05 . The y-intercept is at (11.9950).
*  A change in any of the  above features causes  a (coeeficient of the feature * 100)% change to price of a house.
# RECOMENDATIONS
From the model results and tableau dashboard visualization we can come up with the following recommendations.
From Model 1.
The square footage of a home has an effect on the price of a house whereby price will increase with increase in footage as per the equation given.
From Model 2.
Areas where houses are similar are likely to have a higher prices for houses. This applies in the real world today where people prefer living in gated controlled development estates.
From Model 3.
The numeric variables of Kings County housing  have an effect on  the price of a house.
From Model 4.
The condition of a house has an effect on the price of the house. House prices increase as the condition level increases.
From Tableau Dashboard.
The location of a house has an effect on its price. The company should consider a house’s location in calculating its price.
