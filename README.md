# PHASE2: HOUSING-PROJECT.
# PROJECT OVERVIEW.
This project entails the use of  multiple linear regression models using  data from ("kc_house_data.csv") to provide advice based on accurate and understandable valuations of the Real Estate sector in Kings County to Vision Real Estate Agency. 
# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.
During this project, I assumed the role of a data scientist whereby I used our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") to generate various business problems that will be the founding blocks of our multiple linear regression models.
# Business problems:
1. Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the location of houses can cause changes in house prices and by how much.

2. Provide insight to Vision Real Estate Agency on how the area of a house above the basement can cause changes in house prices and by how much.
                       
3.  Provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.   
# DATA UNDERSTANDING.
Our dataset("kc_house_data.csv") contains Kings County housing data. The data set consists of 21 columns and 21612 rows.
The columns are: ![1_tfBY7bRc6ttOaBmUX4RVyg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110511316/192426070-98622317-8209-4533-b909-d2978a2ec870.png)
# DATA CLEANING.
This was done to ensure the Validity, Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency and Uniformity of the Data.

TASK1 :The first task was to check if the column names were uniform and readable.

TASK2 :The second task was to check for duplcated rows.

TASK3 :The next task was to check if there were missing values.

TASK4 :The next task was to decide how to deal with the missing values. (Either drop if they are unnecesary or replace the missing values with the best fit.)

TASK5 :The last task was to check if the columns had the correct data type.
